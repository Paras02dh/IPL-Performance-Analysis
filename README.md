# 🏏 IPL-Performance-Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing **Indian Premier League (IPL)** matches using Python.
It covers **data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization**.

The project highlights **key patterns in team performance, player stats, and match outcomes** across different IPL seasons.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Clean and preprocess raw IPL data for analysis.
* Perform **EDA** to find trends, patterns, and insights.
* Create **data visualizations**.
* Build a foundation for predictive modeling and dashboards.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset includes IPL **matches** details from 2008–2024.

* **matches.csv** → Match-level details (season, venue, toss, result, etc.).
> Source: Kaggle & official IPL data

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
* **Optional Tools:** SQL, Power BI (for extended analysis)

## 🔍 Key Analyses & Insights

✔️ Matches per season & overall trends
✔️ Toss decisions and win percentage impact
✔️ Highest & lowest team totals
✔️ Top batsmen 
✔️ Venue-wise winning patterns
✔️ Super overs, DLS-affected & rain-interrupted matches
✔️ Extras distribution (wides, no-balls, byes)

## 📊 Sample Visualizations

* Season-wise match distribution
* Team winning consistency
* Toss decision vs result analysis
* Venue-based success rate

## 📌 Future Enhancements

* Build **machine learning models** to predict match outcomes.
* Create **interactive dashboards** (Power BI / Tableau / Streamlit).
* Extend the analytical framework to other cricket leagues and tournaments
